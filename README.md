# node_project
This project is a first glance at node on day 1.  I had to create an endpoint /lorem that would return 3 paragraphs when it was
accessed.  The hard mode was to take /lorem/number and create that many paragraphs.  I did that also, but was unable to get suffix
to work to find a way to segment the paragraphs in the HTML.  It does segment them in the console of chrome.
